# Orientation for Tutors

Expectations from tutors:

* Responsive: As a tutor you will be working with the instructor and the students. You are expected to respond to be respond appropriately and in a timely fashion (slack/Piazza/email)
* Reliabile: This means showing up ON TIME to your scheduled lab hours, keeping up with your commitments and deadlines
* Proactive: Observe the students in your lab sections and offer to assist them. You must appear “available” to students during your hours and not immersed in your devices.
* Prepared: Read the lab instructions carefully before appearing for your sections, read the lecture slides
* Helpful: Be respectful and try your best. Say I don’t know when you really don't but seek help from the TA or instructor to make sure that the student received the help they need. 
* Ethical: You must follow good ethics in your ineteraction with students and are required by university rules to report any cases of harrassment or inappropriate behavior to you instructor immediately
