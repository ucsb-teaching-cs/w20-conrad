## Goal
* Learn about different debugging techniques
* Debugging tools: gdb
* As a tutor you are not expected to debug student code for them, instead you want to guide students to use some of the debugging strategies that you would use if you were actually debugging the code.

Matthew Dupree (former intern at GreenHills) gave a guest lecture on debugging. Slides of this talk can be found here: [Debugging Slides](https://cs.ucsb.edu/~richert/cs190j/CS190DebuggingPresentation.pdf)
