# Lesson plan

### What are we practicing?

* Being welcoming, encouraging, and mindful of your tone and body language
* Giving students the appropriate level of help
* Helping students pick up cool debugging strategies
* Use of visualizations, explanations and other techniques when appropriate
* Managing your time (rule of thumb is to keep your interaction under 10 minutes, although depends on the context)

### Structure of the session

Prior to the class we invite all tutors to submit the hardest questions they were asked so far related to concepts and code. Students submit buggy student-code prior to the class on Gradescope.

In class we'll have mini mock tutoring sessions. At the end of each session, all participants write short reflections and the experienced tutors provide helpful feedback

## About the activity (5 to 10 minutes per student)

* Students will form groups of 4.
* One person assumes the role of a student, another that of a tutor. The others in thee group (including the lead tutors / instructors) are observers.
* The 190J tutor who submitted their version of buggy code will play the role of a student seeking assistance. Another 190J tutor will play the role of the tutor (unaware of what the bug is) and assist the "student" through their problem.
* The "student" should ask the tutor a question related to the code. The tutor should appropriately engage with the student to help them solve the problem.
* Each interaction should nominally take 10 minutes. If the interaction ends in less than 5 minutes, the student should proceed to ask a second question.
* Complete the relections and feedback described below. Please write your feedback
* Switch roles and repeat

### Reflections and feedback (5 minutes per student)

* After each tutoring session, all the observers (including the lead tutor) should fill this form about the interaction [peer-review observation form](https://forms.gle/YyzRFo5bQeUrk7kU9)

* The student who assumed the role of a "tutor" should fill this reflection form: [190J-tutor reflection form](https://forms.gle/dYmEu771ktzcRr417) 

* The lead tutors go over the feedback in the observation form and summarize the feedback for the tutors
